git commit blocked by the zy-skills review gate.

This repo ran /setup-skills, so agent-made commits need a passing review first:

1. Run the /review skill against the uncommitted changes (fixed point HEAD, diff `git diff HEAD`).
2. If both axes report no hard violations, /review records approval for this exact diff.
3. Retry the same git commit — it goes through.

Any change to the diff after the review invalidates the approval and review must re-run.
To commit without a review, ask the user to run git commit in their own terminal.
